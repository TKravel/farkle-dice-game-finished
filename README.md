# Farkle!

Farkle is a multiplayer dice game. Take turns rolling 6 dice trying to get 1's, 5's, or 3 of a kind. After you roll the dice you may select which dice to keep then you must decide if you are going to bank your points or let it ride. Be careful, if you roll the remaining dice without matching a 1, 5, or 3 of a kind you got farkled and lose your turn and any points from the round. First person to reach 10,000 points initiates the end game countdown. Each person will have 2 more turns before a finally count will determin the winner.
